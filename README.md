# JBProjectsPython
Repository for my JetBrains Academy projects. 
I've included the level of difficulty that JetBrains has attached to each project. They range in difficulty from easy to challenging. 

## Banking.py - level medium
banking.py is a 'medium' difficulty project that I am working on through Jetbrains academy. The goal of the project is to create a simple banking system that uses a database in python.
