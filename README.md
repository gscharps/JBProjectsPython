# JBProjectsPython
Repository for my JetBrains Academy projects. 
I've included the level of difficulty that JetBrains has attached to each project. They range in difficulty from easy to challenging. 

## Tic-tac-toe - level easy
This is a 'easy' Python project that I worked on where two users can play against each other in a game of tic tac toe using the standard output and input. 

## Banking.py - level medium
banking.py is a 'medium' difficulty project that I am working on through Jetbrains academy. The goal of the project is to create a simple banking system that uses a database in python.
