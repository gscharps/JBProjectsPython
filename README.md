## Banking.py
banking.py is a project that I completed through JetBrains Academy. The goal was to create a simple banking system that uses a database in python. 


- Allow the user to create a new bank account where their username is a credit card number and their password is their pin. 
- Save and load account data in 'card' database. 
- Keep track of balances for each account. 
- Incorporate the ability to transfer money to another account
- Add money to account
- Log in, Log out
- check current balance of account
